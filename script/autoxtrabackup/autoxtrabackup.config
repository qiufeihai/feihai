# How many hours between full backups?
# For example if set to 12 hours and the script runs every hour, the
# script will create a full backup at 12:00, and create incremental
# backups until 23:00. At 00:00, it will create the next full backup, and so on.
# Keep in mind, incremental backups are only applicable for XtraDB/InnoDB tables.
